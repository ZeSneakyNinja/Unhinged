FTB Unhinged files 'n' such


The main point of this repository is to share my Forestry backpack config, which adds (almost) all of the items in the FTB Unhinged mod pack.
The backpacks.conf is pre-setup to allow all blocks in the Adventurer's Backpack.
Some values may have been deleted during debug, so some items may not work, simply add "id:*;" to the list, follow what is already there as a template.
I have also included "list.txt", which is a simple list of the item id's that you can copy and past into your own config if you wish.
